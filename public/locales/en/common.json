An important advantage of the personalized rehabilitation process is therefore the possibility of carrying out a program studied on the individuality of the patient to identify the best treatment and ensure maximum functional recovery. Each session is individual and the personalized rehabilitation program offers the possibility of a global intervention for the resolution of the problem, where the patient and his pathology are at the center of our care, from start to finish.",
